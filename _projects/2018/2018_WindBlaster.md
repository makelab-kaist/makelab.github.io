<!-- Abstract -->
Ungrounded haptic force-feedback is a crucial element for applications that aim to immerse users in virtual environments where mobility is important, like Virtual Reality games. In this work, we present a wearable interface that generates force-feedback by spinning two drone propellers mounted on a wrist. The device is interfaced with a game running in Unity and can render different haptic stimuli mapped to four weapons. A simple evaluation with users demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed approach.
