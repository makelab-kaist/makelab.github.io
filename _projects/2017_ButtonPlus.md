<!-- Abstract -->
Shape-changing interfaces combine the simplicity of tangible interfaces with dynamic physical affordances and are an emerging area in HCI research. Unlike previous work that focused on technical aspects and actuator properties, this study classifies shape-changing interfaces based on user context and identity. After introducing a new shape-changing pushbutton prototype, workshops with designers and engineers explored its design space and applications. The findings led to a generalized taxonomy of interactions and the development of two applications reflecting this model. The paper concludes by suggesting future research directions for context- and user-aware shape-changing interfaces.
