ShrinkCells are shape-changing actuators made from 3D printed thermoplastic polymers that use localized heat generated by conductive PLA to selectively trigger the shrinking of a Shape Memory Polymer. Unlike existing methods that apply global heat, ShrinkCells enable independent, simultaneous, or sequential control of multiple parts of an object using a single power supply. This allows 3D printed rigid structures to actuate in sequence and avoid self-collisions during unfolding. The work advances 4D fabrication through systematic study of selective heating, design and evaluation of ShrinkCells, and demonstration of their applications.
