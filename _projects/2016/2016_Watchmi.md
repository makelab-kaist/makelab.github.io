<!-- Abstract -->
WatchMI is a system that enhances smartwatch touch interaction by supporting continuous pressure touch, twist, and pan gestures through software that analyzes data from the watch's built-in Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in real-time. This approach requires no additional hardware or modifications. Evaluations show that the input methods are accurate, noise-resistant, and user-friendly, and can be implemented on various smartwatches. The system's potential is demonstrated through seven applications, including map navigation, alarm clock, music player, text entry, file exploration, and remote device or game character control.
