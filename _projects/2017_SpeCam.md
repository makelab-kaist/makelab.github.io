🏅 _Honorable Mention Award_

SpeCam is a lightweight surface color and material sensing approach for mobile devices that only uses the front-facing camera and the display as a multi-spectral light source. We leverage the natural use of mobile devices (placing them face-down) to detect the material underneath and, therefore, infer the location or placement of the device. SpeCam can then be used to support discreet micro-interactions to avoid the numerous distractions that users face daily with today's mobile devices. Our two-part study shows that SpeCam can i) recognize colors in the HSB space with 10 degrees apart near the three dominant colors and 4 degrees otherwise, and ii) identify 30 types of surface materials with 99% accuracy. These findings are further supported by a spectroscopy study. Finally, we suggest a series of applications based on simple mobile micro-interactions suitable for using the phone when placed face-down.
