Smart-rings are well-suited for subtle, always-available haptic notifications due to their direct skin contact. While previous research has shown the feasibility of haptic technology in smart-rings using limited finger locations, the potential of poking to convey richer information has been underexplored. Through three studies involving 76 participants, the design of PokeRing was developed, a smart-ring that stimulates eight locations around the index finger's proximal phalanx. The evaluation demonstrated PokeRing's performance in realistic conditions (standing and walking) and its effectiveness in conveying information using twenty-one spatio-temporal patterns created by six interaction designers. Additionally, three applications utilizing PokeRing's notification capabilities are presented.
