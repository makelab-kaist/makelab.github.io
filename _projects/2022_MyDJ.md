Various automated eating detection wearables have been developed to monitor food intake, addressing the limitations of manual journaling. However, many existing systems lack accuracy in real-world settings or have intrusive designs like headgear. Eyeglasses present a socially acceptable alternative, but current solutions require custom frames and high power consumption. We introduce MyDJ, an eating detection system attachable to any eyeglass frame, which combines a piezoelectric sensor and an accelerometer to capture chewing signals accurately and efficiently. Tested with 30 subjects in uncontrolled environments, including a week-long trial with six users wearing MyDJ on their own glasses, the system achieved a 91.9% F1-score in detecting eating episodes and offered 5.1 times longer battery life compared to existing technologies. Participants also found MyDJ nearly as comfortable (94.8%) as regular eyeglasses.
