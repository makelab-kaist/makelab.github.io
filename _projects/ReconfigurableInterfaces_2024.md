Reconfigurable physical interfaces empower users to swiftly adapt them for tailored requirements or preferences. Shape-changing interfaces enable such reconfigurability, avoiding the cost of refabrication or replacements of parts that traditional interfaces entail. However, reconfigurable interfaces are often bulky, expensive, or inaccessible. We propose a reversible shape-changing mechanism that enables reconfigurable 3D printed structures via translations and rotations of parts. We investigate a fabrication technique that allows the reconfiguring of interfaces using magnets and the thermoplastic nature of heated polymer. Proposed tangible interfaces achieve fine-tunable haptic feedback and adjustment of different user affordances by reconfiguring input motions. We present a design space and demonstrate it through applications in rehabilitation, communication, accessibility, safety, and gaming.
