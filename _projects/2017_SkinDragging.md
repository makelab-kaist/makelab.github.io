<!-- Abstract -->
Skin-dragging is a new haptic feedback method that delivers precise spatial and temporal tactile cues by moving a small pin across the skin. Although previous research developed various wearable skin-dragging devices and tested their feasibility, user perception of these stimuli and optimal design of dragging motion patterns for finger feedback remain unclear. This study addresses these questions by having designers create dragging motions varying in speed, direction, and length. The motions were tested using a haptic smart-ring, classified, and guidelines were derived to enable rich and informative finger feedback.
