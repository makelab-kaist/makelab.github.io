<!-- Abstract -->
SpeCam is a lightweight surface color and material sensing approach for mobile devices that uses only the front-facing camera and the display as a multi-spectral light source. By leveraging the natural behavior of placing a phone face-down, SpeCam detects the underlying material and infers the device’s location or placement context.

This capability enables discreet micro-interactions designed to reduce everyday mobile distractions. A two-part evaluation demonstrates that SpeCam can:  i) recognize colors in the HSB space with 10-degree separation near dominant colors and 4-degree separation otherwise, and ii) identify 30 different surface materials with 99% accuracy. These findings are further supported by a spectroscopy validation study. The paper concludes by proposing applications that leverage simple, unobtrusive micro-interactions when a phone is placed face-down.
