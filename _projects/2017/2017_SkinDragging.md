<!-- Abstract -->
Skin-dragging is a haptic feedback method that delivers precise spatial and temporal tactile cues by moving a small pin across the skin. Although previous research introduced wearable skin-dragging devices and demonstrated their feasibility, user perception of these stimuli and the optimal design of dragging motion patterns for finger feedback remain unclear. 

This study investigates these questions by asking designers to create dragging motions that vary in speed, direction, and length. The motions were evaluated using a haptic smart ring, systematically classified, and distilled into design guidelines to enable rich and informative finger-based tactile feedback.
