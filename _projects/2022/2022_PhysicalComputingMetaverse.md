<!-- Abstract -->
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected education, particularly in STEAM subjects like Interaction Prototyping, which relies heavily on physical practice. Although virtual environments in STEAM education existed before the pandemic, the shift to remote learning increased the need for such solutions. This paper proposes virtual reality applications for remote interaction prototyping education, offering students an intuitive and safe practice environment. It reviews the class structure and challenges before and after COVID-19 through expert interviews, identifies design considerations for transitioning to a virtual format, and presents four immersive interaction scenarios: realistic theory classes, a 3D library, circuit assembly, and mixed reality practice.

This project was in collaboration with the **KAIST Global Strategy Institute**.
