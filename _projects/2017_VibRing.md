Capacitive touchscreens have transformed user interaction by enabling intuitive multi-finger input. However, current touchscreens cannot differentiate between individual fingers or users, limiting touch expressiveness. This paper proposes enhancing touch input with a smart-ring that transmits a unique ID via vibration patterns when in contact with the screen, allowing distinction between users and assigning different meanings to touches. The paper explores this concept and presents applications demonstrating its feasibility.
