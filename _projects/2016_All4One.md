Despite the rise of online tools for remote teamwork, early-stage collaborative activities like brainstorming are still not well supported. This paper presents All4One, a networked system allowing multiple remote users to engage in moderated visual sketching sessions. Participants can draw and share sketches via tablets, while a moderator arranges and manipulates these sketches on a real-time whiteboard using tangible tools. A workshop study with designers demonstrated various usage patterns and highlighted the system's potential in early design stages, emphasizing the moderator's crucial role. The paper concludes by discussing the system's strengths, weaknesses, and future development directions.
