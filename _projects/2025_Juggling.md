This paper explores how users coordinate supernumerary virtual and real arms to perform complex tasks in VR. Through a study with 14 participants using a Wizard-of-Oz setup, qualitative and quantitative data were collected on control strategies, task performance, and embodiment. Findings show that users adapt their control methods based on task complexity and system intelligence, influencing task management and embodiment experience. The study concludes with guidelines to enhance multi-arm interaction design in future applications.
