<!-- Abstract -->
Haptic perception of physical sizes enhances realism and immersion in Virtual Reality (VR). Traditional methods use pressure on fingertips or shape-changing devices, which are limited by their physical forms, restricting the simulation of objects larger or smaller than the device. Inspired by pseudo-haptics research on visual influence over haptic perception, this study developed a fixed-size VR controller that uses finger repositioning to create a visuo-haptic illusion of dynamic size changes in virtual objects. Two user studies showed that with size-changing visual context, users perceived virtual objects as 44.2% smaller to 160.4% larger than the device size, while without visuals, a constant size of 141.4% of the device size was perceived.
