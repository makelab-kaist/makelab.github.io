Online fitness video tutorials are a popular way to exercise at home without a personal trainer, but users often disrupt their balance and motion flow by trying to keep the video in view. Previous research addressed this issue only for limited views and simple movements. To support fluid execution of complex full-body yoga exercises, we propose FlowAR, an augmented reality system that displays training videos as virtual overlays around the user. We tested various overlay layouts with 16 participants using motion capture, then refined the prototype and evaluated it in a home-like lab with 12 users. Results demonstrate the benefits of different visualizations and the system's broad applicability.
