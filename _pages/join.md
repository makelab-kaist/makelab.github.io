### General questions

<blockquote class="question-quote">How can I express interest in joining the lab?</blockquote>

You can let us know by filling out [this form](https://forms.gle/i1aJLuJLCiLXvmGL7). This is a _preliminary_ and _optional_ expression of interest and must be followed by a formal application to our graduate program.

<blockquote class="question-quote">Where can I find more admission details?</blockquote>

Please refer to the official KAIST [admission site](https://admission.kaist.ac.kr) and the Industrial Design Department [FAQs](https://id.kaist.ac.kr/education/PhD) for Master and Doctoral programs.

<blockquote class="question-quote">What research areas does the lab focus on?</blockquote>

We are interested in building tools that support **creativity**, **physical computaitonal interaction**, and **making practices** by _blending software and hardware_. Our work often involves technologies such as _AI_, Extended Reality (_XR_), _digital fabrication_, _physical computing_, _haptics_, and _robotics_. Please check our latest projects to get a sense of our current research direction.

<blockquote class="question-quote">Are graduate students funded?</blockquote>

Yes. All MS and Ph.D. students are _fully funded_. They receive:

- A government scholarship  
- A lab stipend (a minimum national stipend is guaranteed by law)  

<blockquote class="question-quote">How long are the degree programs?</blockquote>

- **MS**: 2 years  
- **Ph.D.**: Typically 4 years (generally 3–5 years)  
- **MS+Ph.D. integrated**: 5 years total  

<blockquote class="question-quote">Are the programs taught in English?</blockquote>

Yes. All programs are conducted in _English_.  
Knowledge of Korean is not required (though appreciated).

<blockquote class="question-quote">Do I need a design background to apply?</blockquote>

No. We welcome students from a wide range of majors, including design, architecture, computer science, and various engineering fields. A formal background in design is not required.


### Ph.D. program

<blockquote class="question-quote">What are the expectations for Ph.D. applicants?</blockquote>

Ideal candidates should have prior research experience (preferably in HCI) and proven technical capabilities such as:

- Programming  
- Electronics  
- Digital fabrication / mechanical design  
- Statistics and research methods (e.g., user studies)  

<blockquote class="question-quote">What is the structure of the Ph.D. program?</blockquote>

In the first two years:

- Coursework  
- Qualifying exam  
- Initial research activities  

In the final years:

- Publications  
- Dissertation preparation  

<blockquote class="question-quote">How do I apply for the Ph.D. program?</blockquote>

You must:

1. Apply through the official KAIST admission system: [https://admission.kaist.ac.kr](https://admission.kaist.ac.kr)  
2. Select the Department of Industrial Design.  
3. Indicate Professor Andrea Bianchi as a potential advisor.  

You are encouraged to first submit the expression-of-interest through this [form](https://forms.gle/i1aJLuJLCiLXvmGL7).

Applications are accepted year-round for the next available Spring or Fall semester.


### Master’s program

<blockquote class="question-quote">Is the Master’s program research-oriented?</blockquote>

Yes. The MS program is research-oriented. In addition to coursework, students are expected to actively conduct research.

<blockquote class="question-quote">How often are Master’s positions available?</blockquote>

We offer a fully funded Master’s position every Spring and Fall semester.

<blockquote class="question-quote">Is there an integrated Master’s + Ph.D. option?</blockquote>

Yes. We offer a 5-year integrated program: 1 year of Master’s followed by 4 years of Ph.D.

<blockquote class="question-quote">How do I apply for the Master’s program?</blockquote>

You can:

- Apply directly via the KAIST admission site: [https://admission.kaist.ac.kr](https://admission.kaist.ac.kr)  
- International applicants may also fill out the expression-of-interest through this [form](https://forms.gle/i1aJLuJLCiLXvmGL7).

<blockquote class="question-quote">Can the lab directly admit students?</blockquote>

No. Labs cannot directly admit students because the admission process is centralized.

Applicants must apply to KAIST and indicate:

- The Department of Industrial Design  
- The specific lab (e.g., Professor Andrea Bianchi’s Make Lab)  

Admissions decisions are made by a departmental committee.


### For prospective international students

<blockquote class="question-quote">Are international students funded?</blockquote>

Yes. International students (Master’s and Ph.D.) are fully funded under the same conditions as domestic students.

<blockquote class="question-quote">Is Korean language proficiency required?</blockquote>

No. English is the official language for courses and research. Korean may be helpful for daily life, but it is not required.


### For prospective KAIST interns

<blockquote class="question-quote">How can KAIST students apply for internships or URP?</blockquote>

If you are currently registered at KAIST (including exchange students), please fill out the interest  
[form](https://forms.gle/i1aJLuJLCiLXvmGL7).

Please note that students are generally expected to have taken my courses ([Software Prototyping](https::/software.prototyping.id), [Designing Interaction with AI]((https::/ai.prototyping.id)), [Designing Interaction with Hardware]((https::/hardware.prototyping.id))) or to have a comparable background before starting the internship.


### For visitors

<blockquote class="question-quote">Do you accept visiting researchers from other institutions?</blockquote>

Yes, but:

- Applicants must have strong recommendations from colleagues or peers in the HCI field.  
- International visitors must commit to staying for at least 6 months.  

<blockquote class="question-quote">What are the visa requirements for international visitors?</blockquote>

Foreign visitors must obtain a valid visa through the KAIST Visiting Research Program.
