## TL;DR

- If interested in joining the lab, let us know by filling out **[this form](https://forms.gle/i1aJLuJLCiLXvmGL7)**.
- We are **looking for grad students** (MS and Ph.D.) interested in interactive systems, VR, haptics and robots, digital fabrication, etc.
- MS and Ph.D. students are **fully funded** and receive a government scholarship plus a lab stipend.
- MS is **2** years, Ph.D. is **4** years, while the MS+PhD combined program is **5** years.
- All programs are in **English**, and knowledge of Korean is not necessary (though certainly appreciated).
- For Ph.D., I expect some prior research **experience** and some proven technical **capabilities** (e.g., coding, making, stats, research methods, statistics).
- We welcome students with many majors of origin. It is OK to not have a formal background in design.
- For **internships** and **visitors**, we welcome KAIST students and only consider applicants from elsewhere with strong recommendations. Additionally, undergraduate students should be at least in their third year (junior) and have taken courses such as [Software Prototyping](https://software.prototyping.id) and [Interaction Prototyping](https://sites.google.com/view/interaction-prototyping/home).

## For prospective Ph.D. students

We are always looking for passionate students interested in our Ph.D. program in the Department of Industrial Design at KAIST (ID KAIST) and eager to work on topics such as **interactive systems and digital fabrication**. Applications are accepted throughout the year and finalized in admission for the next available term (_spring_ or _fall_ semester).

The Ph.D. program at KAIST is **fully funded**, and it typically ranges between 3-5 years, with 4 years being the typical length of the program. In the first two years, you will focus on coursework and passing a qualifying exam while also starting your dive into research. In the last two years, you will work on publications and on preparing your dissertation.

Ideal candidates for the Ph.D. program should have some **prior research experience** (preferably in the field of HCI) and **technical capabilities** in designing or building interactive systems (e.g., programming, electronics, mechanical design, fabrication, user studies) demonstrated through their personal work or portfolio. We encourage students from a _variety of majors_ to apply. Current and past lab members came from diverse fields such as **design, art, business, architecture, computer science, and mechanical engineering**.

Students are encouraged to express their intention to apply by filling out **[this form](https://forms.gle/i1aJLuJLCiLXvmGL7)**. Please note that this form is just a _preliminary and optional expression of interest_, while for the admission, you will still have to go through the official application process via [the KAIST admission system](https://admission.kaist.ac.kr). Students interested in obtaining a degree under my supervision should apply to the Department of Industrial Design at KAIST and indicate Prof. Andrea Bianchi as a potential advisor.

## For Master's program applicants

**Make Lab** in the department of Industrial Design at KAIST (ID KAIST) offers a **fully-funded** Master's opening position **every** _spring_ and _fall_ semesters. Similarly to the doctorate progra, also the Master's program is **research-oriented**, which means that on top of your coursework, you are expected to conduct research. The Master's program lasts two years. We also offer a **Masters+Ph.D. integrated** program (1 year Master's followed by 4 years for Ph.D.). Strong candidates are encouraged to fill **[this form](https://forms.gle/i1aJLuJLCiLXvmGL7)** for an expression of interest or go ahead and directly apply [here](https://admission.kaist.ac.kr).

### Admission process

For the application process, please refer to the [KAIST admission site](https://admission.kaist.ac.kr). You might want to let us know in advance about your interest in applying by filling out **[this form](https://forms.gle/i1aJLuJLCiLXvmGL7)**.

To further clarify how admissions work at KAIST, labs cannot directly accept students. Instead, students interested in our graduate programs should apply to KAIST and indicate in which department and lab they would like to work (e.g., _Professor Andrea Bianchi's Make Lab_). A committee composed of all the professors will judge each candidate and grant or deny admission through the reviewing process.

Admitted graduate students receive a basic scholarship from KAIST and a stipend from the lab, depending on the availability of projects and student involvement (a minimum national stipend is always guaranteed by law). For further questions, please refer to this list of [Q&As](https://id.kaist.ac.kr/index.php?mid=FAQ).

### For international applicants (Master's or Ph.D.)

- Like domestic candidates, international students are also fully funded.
- English is the official language used for courses and research. Knowing some Korean might help, but it is not necessary.

## For perspective internships

If you are currently registered as a KAIST student (including students visiting for a semester/year from other universities) and are interested in an internship in our lab or in starting a URP (Undergraduate Research Program) under the supervision of Professor Bianchi, please fill out **[this form](https://forms.gle/i1aJLuJLCiLXvmGL7)**.

Our lab welcomes visiting researchers from other institutions in Korea or abroad with a similar research interest to ours. However, **we only consider applicants recommended by colleagues or peers in the HCI field**. We also only consider international applicants that can commit to staying for **at least 6 months**. If you are a foreigner, you also need to obtain a valid VISA through our school's [Visiting Research Program](https://io.kaist.ac.kr/menu/io.do?mguid=D4CD2D0A-21E5-E511-940C-2C44FD7DF8B9).
